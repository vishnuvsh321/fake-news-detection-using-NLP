He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency. It s a badly scripted reality TV show.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.\",\n          \"Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day message to rebuke Donald Trump without even mentioning his name. The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.\",\n          \"On Friday, it was revealed that former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, who was being considered for Homeland Security Secretary in Donald Trump s administration, has an email scandal of his own.In January, there was a brief run-in on a plane between Clarke and fellow passenger Dan Black, who he later had detained by the police for no reason whatsoever, except that maybe his feelings were hurt. Clarke messaged the police to stop Black after he deplaned, and now, a search warrant has been executed by the FBI to see the exchanges.Clarke is calling it fake news even though copies of the search warrant are on the Internet.

Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration\\u2019s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. \\u201cThe Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD\\u2019s study and will continue to defend the president\\u2019s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,\\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: \\u201cAs mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.\\u201d Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal \\u201cgreat news.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it\\u2019s not good for the military or our country,\\u201d Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama\\u2019s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military \\u201ccannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\\u201d Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump\\u2019s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president\\u2019s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants\\u2019 sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept \\u201csome individuals who are not medically fit for service.\\u201d The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump\\u2019s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president\\u2019s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity. \",\n          \"SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge \\u201cmuch more\\u201d to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     \\u201cWhy is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!\\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president\\u2019s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the \\u201cAmazon Washington Post\\u201d fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump\\u2019s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. \\u201cWe do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,\\u201d he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers\\u2019 doorsteps. Amazon\\u2019s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump\\u2019s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its \\u201cproductive relationship\\u201d with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service\\u2019s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump\\u2019s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service\\u2019s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump\\u2019s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. \\u201cThis investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,\\u201d Graham said on CBS\\u2019s Face the Nation news program. \\u201cAnd we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he\\u2019s the right guy at the right time.\\u201d  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump\\u2019s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller\\u2019s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was \\u201cgoing to be fair.\\u201d    Russia\\u2019s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI\\u2019s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller\\u2019s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  \\u201cI want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,\\u201d Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. \\u201cAs a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,\\u201d he said. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"December 31, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

campaign adviser george papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of russian opposition research on hillary clintonon top of that papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for trump as his administration has alleged he had a much larger role but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar coffee boys don t help to arrange a new york meeting between trump and president abdel fattah elsisi of egypt two months before the election it was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for trump but team trump ran with him being merely a coffee

much mr papadopoulos said that night at the kensington wine rooms with the australian alexander downer is unclear the report states but two months later when leaked democratic emails began appearing online australian officials passed the information about mr papadopoulos to their american counterparts according to four current and former american and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the

without even mentioning his name the pope delivered his message just days after members of the united nations condemned trump s move to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel the pontiff prayed on monday for the peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders we see jesus in the children of the middle east who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between israelis and palestinians francis said on this festive day let us ask the lord for peace for jerusalem and for all the holy land let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached the pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes and that is an issue trump continues to fight against francis used jesus for which there was no place in the inn as an analogy today as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human societal and environmental decline christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the child and to recognize him in the faces of little children especially those for whom like jesus there is no place in the inn he said jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head he added may our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of bethlehem the pope said that mary and joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in bethlehem they had to leave their people their home and their land francis said this was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child at heart they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind so many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of joseph and mary francis said sunday we see the tracks

judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on jan a justice department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings the department of defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks so rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs the administration has decided to wait for dods study and will continue to defend the presidents lawful authority in district court in the meantime the official said speaking on condition of anonymity in september the pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving the defense department has until feb to submit a plan to trump lawyers representing currentlyserving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservativemajority supreme court but were hoping that would not happen pentagon spokeswoman heather babb said in a statement as mandated by court order the department of defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service jan all applicants must meet all accession standards jennifer levi a lawyer with gay lesbian and transgender advocacy group glad called the decision not to appeal great news im hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that its not good for the military or our country levi said both glad and the american civil liberties union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration in a move that appealed to his hardline conservative supporters trump announced in july that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military reversing democratic president barack obamas policy of accepting them trump said on twitter at the time that the military cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail four federal judges in baltimore washington dc seattle and riverside california have issued rulings blocking trumps ban while legal challenges to the republican presidents policy proceed the judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the us constitution to equal protection under the law the pentagon on dec issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by jan the memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear the trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept some individuals who are not medically fit for service the obama administration had set a deadline of july to begin accepting transgender recruits but trumps defense secretary james mattis postponed that date to jan which the presidents ban then put off indefinitely trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights in october his administration said a federal law banning genderbased workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees reversing another obamaera position in february trump rescinded

postal service to charge much more for amazon shipments seattlewashington reuters president donald trump called on the us postal service on friday to charge much more to ship packages for amazon amzno picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer should be charging much more trump wrote on twitter the presidents tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the postal service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season the us postal service which runs at a big loss is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses according to its website package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of firstclass letters the president does not determine postal rates they are set by the postal regulatory commission an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties that panel raised prices on packages by almost percent in november amazon was founded by jeff bezos who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world according to bloomberg news bezos also owns the washington post a newspaper trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media in tweets over the past year trump has said the amazon washington post fabricated stories he has said amazon does not pay sales tax which is not true and so hurts other retailers part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big american companies since he took office in january daniel ives a research analyst at gbh insights said trumps comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant however he said he was not concerned for amazon we do not see any price hikes in the future however that is a risk that amazon is clearly aware of and it is building out its distribution system aggressively he said amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service including testing drones for deliveries in the company spent billion on shipping percent of its total operating expenses that year amazon shares were down percent to by early afternoon overall us stock prices were down slightly on friday satish jindel president of shipmatrix inc which analyzes shipping data disputed the idea that the postal service charges less than united parcel service inc upsn and fedex corp fdxn the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the united states many customers get lower rates from ups and fedex than they would get from the post office for comparable services he said the postal service delivers about percent of amazon packages for about to million a day during the current peak yearend holiday shipping season jindel said the seattlebased company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys from post offices to customers doorsteps amazons no carrier is ups at percent and fedex is third with percent or so according to jindel trumps comment tapped into a debate over whether postal service pricing has kept pace with the rise of ecommerce which has flooded the mail with small packagesprivate companies like ups have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business steve gaut a spokesman for ups noted that the company values its productive relationship with the postal service but that it has filed with the postal regulatory commission its concerns about the postal services methods for covering costs representatives for amazon the white house the us postal service and fedex declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on trumps tweet according to its annual report the postal service lost billion this year and its deficit has ballooned to billion while the postal services revenue for first class mail marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining revenue from package delivery is up percent since to billion in the fiscal year ended sept but it also lost about billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in april according to a government accountability office report in february the service is facing growing personnel expenses particularly billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities the postal service has not announced any plans to cut costs by law the postal service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service but the postal service allocates only percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line

without political interference this investigation will go forward it will be an investigation conducted without political influence graham said on cbss face the nation news program and we all need to let mr mueller do his job i think hes the right guy at the right time the question of how russia may have interfered in the election and how trumps campaign may have had links with or coordinated any such effort has loomed over the white house since trump took office in january it shows no sign of receding as trump prepares for his second year in power despite intensified rhetoric from some trump allies in recent weeks accusing muellers team of bias against the republican president trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the new york times in which he said he expected mueller was going to be fair russias role in the election and the question of possible links to the trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in washington three committees of the senate and the house of representatives are investigating as well as mueller whose team in may took over an earlier probe launched by the us federal bureau of investigation fbi several members of the trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation trump and his allies deny any collusion with russia during the campaign and the kremlin has denied meddling in the election graham said he still wants an examination of the fbis use of a dossier on links between trump and russia that was compiled by a former british spy christopher steele which prompted trump allies and some republicans to question muellers inquiry on saturday the new york times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early fbi probe but a tip from former trump campaign foreign policy adviser george papadopoulos to an australian diplomat that russia had damaging information about former trump rival hillary clinton i want somebody to look at the way the

Police fired tear gas on Thursday at the protesting students. Video footage posted on social media later in the day showed uniformed officers outside dormitories and inside classrooms using batons to hit people who did not appear to be involved in the campus protests.  It was the latest crackdown by police on protests since an Aug. 8 presidential election that was later annulled by the Supreme Court. A re-run of the vote has been set for Oct. 26. The Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA)  this morning noted from social media reports of an incident in which members of the National Police Service allegedly stormed the University of Nairobi and assaulted students at the institution,  the authority said on its Twitter feed.  It requested that any member of the public come forward to provide information to aid the investigation.  The students had been protesting against the re-arrest of a lawmaker, Paul Ongili Owino, on Wednesday, shortly after he was released on bail on charges of subversion for calling President Uhuru Kenyatta a  son of a dog  at a campaign rally. Kenya is a key Western ally in a region often roiled by violence. Preparations for the re-run of the election are being closely monitored for signs of instability, after at least 28 people were killed in unrest following the Aug. 8 vote. The IPOA watchdog was created in 2011, after police came under severe criticism for the number of protesters killed during demonstrations against disputed elections in 2007. The violence then killed around 1,2000 people. But local and international rights groups say the institution is struggling to fulfill its mandate to investigate allegations of police brutality in a country rife with reports from civilians of extrajudicial killings by security forces.  The IPOA has secured two convictions of police officers in the four years it has been operational. The watchdog pledged last month to fast-track investigations into high-profile deaths such as that of a baby allegedly killed by police in the violence after the election. [L4N1L34FC] But people familiar with the status of these investigations say the police are not cooperating with them, and that senior officials in the police force and the interior ministry insist officers killed only thieves and thugs. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON/CAIRO (Reuters) - Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an EgyptAir flight from Cairo to New York on Saturday after President Donald Trump halted the entry of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, sources at Cairo airport said. The passengers, arriving in transit to Cairo airport, were stopped and re-directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas, the sources said.  Trump on Friday put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, saying the moves would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. He said his most sweeping use of his presidential powers since taking office a week ago, barring travelers from the seven nations for at least 90 days, would give his administration time to develop more stringent screening procedures for refugees, immigrants and visitors. \\u201cI\\u2019m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don\\u2019t want them here,\\u201d Trump said earlier on Friday at the Pentagon. \\u201cWe only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,\\u201d he said. The bans, though temporary, took effect immediately, causing havoc and confusion for would-be travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Besides Cairo it was not immediately clear whether other  airports of countries listed by Trump had swiftly implemented the ban. Arab officials of the listed countries would not comment on the matter. The order seeks to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution, a move Trump separately said was aimed at helping Christians in Syria. That led some legal experts to question whether the order was constitutional. One group said it would announce a court challenge on Monday. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said the order targets Muslims because of their faith, contravening the U.S. Constitutional right to freedom of religion. \\u201cPresident Trump has cloaked what is a discriminatory ban against nationals of Muslim countries under the banner of national security,\\u201d said Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.  Trump has long pledged to take this kind of action, making it a prominent feature of his campaign for the Nov. 8 election. But people who work with Muslim immigrants and refugees were scrambling to determine the scope of the order. Even legal permanent residents - people with \\u201cgreen cards\\u201d allowing them to live and work in the United States - were being advised to consult immigration lawyers before traveling outside the country, or trying to return, according to Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group in Washington.  On Friday evening, Abed Ayoub of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said he had fielded about 100 queries from people anxious about the order, which he said he believed could affect traveling green card holders, students, people coming to the United States for medical care and others. \\u201cIt\\u2019s chaos,\\u201d Ayoub said. During his campaign, Trump tapped into American fears about Islamic State militants and the flood of migrants into Europe from Syria\\u2019s civil war, saying refugees could be a \\u201cTrojan horse\\u201d that allowed attackers to enter the United States. In December 2015, he called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, drawing fire for suggesting a religious test for immigrants that critics said would violate the U.S. Constitution. His idea later evolved into a proposal for \\u201cextreme vetting.\\u201d  Trump\\u2019s order also suspends the Syrian refugee program until further notice, and will eventually give priority to minority religious groups fleeing persecution.  Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network that the exception would help Syrian Christians fleeing the civil war there. Legal experts were divided on whether this order would be constitutional. \\u201cIf they are thinking about an exception for Christians, in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution,\\u201d said Stephen Legomsky, a former chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration. But Peter Spiro, a professor at Temple University Beasley School of Law, said Trump\\u2019s action would likely be constitutional because the president and Congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a completely plausible prioritization, to the extent this group is actually being persecuted,\\u201d Spiro said. The order may also affect special refugee programs for Iraqis who worked for the U.S. government as translators after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It is already affecting refugees and their families, said Jen Smyers of the Church World Service, a Protestant faith-based group that works with migrants. Smyers said she spoke to an Iraqi mother whose twin daughters remain in Iraq due to processing delays. \\u201cThose two 18-year-old daughters won\\u2019t be able to join their mother in the U.S.,\\u201d she said. Democrats on Friday were quick to condemn Trump\\u2019s order as un-American, saying it would tarnish the reputation of the United States as a land that welcomes immigrants. \\u201cToday\\u2019s executive order from President Trump is more about extreme xenophobia than extreme vetting,\\u201d said Democratic Senator Edward Markey in a statement. Some Republicans praised the move. Representative Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, said Islamic State has threatened to use the U.S. immigration system, making it important to do more screening. \\u201cI am pleased that President Trump is using the tools granted to him by Congress and the power granted by the Constitution to help keep America safe and ensure we know who is entering the United States,\\u201d Goodlatte said in a statement. Without naming Trump, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday it was no time to build walls between nations and criticized steps towards cancelling world trade agreements. Trump on Wednesday ordered the construction of a U.S.-Mexican border wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration. \\u201cToday is not the time to erect walls between nations. They have forgotten that the Berlin wall fell years ago,\\u201d Rouhani said in a speech carried live on Iranian state television. He made no direct reference to Trump\\u2019s order regarding refugees and travelers from the seven mainly Muslim states. Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013, thawed Iran\\u2019s relations with world powers after years of confrontation and engineered its 2015 deal with them under which it curbed its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions. Rouhani said earlier this month that Trump could not unilaterally cancel the nuclear deal and that talk of renegotiating it was \\u201cmeaningless\\u201d. France and Germany voiced disquiet on Saturday over Trump\\u2019s new restrictions on immigration. \\u201cWelcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty,\\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said at a joint news conference with German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel. \\u201cThe United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbor is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people,\\u201d said  Gabriel. \\u201cI think that is what unites us in the West, and I think that is what we want to make clear to the Americans.\\u201d \",\n          \"PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo s center-right coalition led by the Democratic Party of Kosovo signed a deal on Monday with the small New Alliance for Kosovo party to form a government, ending nearly three months of political deadlock after an election on June 11.      Finally Kosovo has started to move ... we had some big delays and our institutions now will be formed,  said Ramush Haradinaj, from the center-right coalition of parties made up of former guerrillas who fought the 1998-99 war against Serb forces. Under the deal, the parties along with ethnic minorities will secure 63 seats in the 120-seat parliament.  President Hashim Thaci is expected to give Haradinaj a mandate to form the government within days. A source who asked not to be named told Reuters the parliament session to elect the parliament speaker would be held this week. Haradinaj, who twice stood trial before the United Nations war crimes court for war crimes and was acquitted, briefly held the post of prime minister in 2005.  The smaller New Alliance for Kosovo party is led by Behgjet Pacolli, who is dubbed by media the richest Kosovar.  Pacolli, who also holds a Swiss passport, won many contracts from the Russian government to rebuild state buildings in Moscow in the  90s but a decade ago he moved his business from Moscow to Kazakhstan.  It is unclear what post Pacolli will hold in the new government.  The new government will have to tackle unemployment running at 30 percent and improve relations with Kosovo s neighbors, especially Serbia, a precondition for both countries to move forward in the European Union accession process. It must also reform health and education and the tax administration system as well as include representatives of some 120,000 Kosovo Serbs who do not recognize independence. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, almost a decade after NATO air strikes drove out Serbian forces accused of expelling and killing ethnic Albanian civilians in a two-year counter-insurgency.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

warning to iraqi kurds over kirkuk sulaimaniabaghdad reuters a senior iranian military commander repeatedly warned kurdish leaders in northern iraq to withdraw from the oil city of kirkuk or face an onslaught by iraqi forces and allied iranianbacked fighters kurdish officials briefed on the meetings said majorgeneral qassem soleimani commander of foreign operations for iran s elite revolutionary guards traveled to iraq s kurdistan region to meet kurdish leaders at least three times this month before the baghdad government s lightning campaign to recapture territory across the north the presence of soleimani on the frontlines highlights tehran s heavy sway over policy in iraq and comes as shi ite iran seeks to win a proxy war in the middle east with its regional rival and us ally sunni saudi arabia soleimani met leaders from the patriotic union of kurdistan puk one of the two main kurdish political parties in northern iraq in the city of sulaimania the day before iraqi prime minister haider alabadi ordered his forces to advance on kirkuk according to a puk lawmaker briefed on the meeting his message was clear withdraw or risk losing tehran as a strategic ally abadi has all the regional powers and the west behind him and nothing will stop him from forcing you to return back to the mountains if he decides so the lawmaker quoted soleimani as telling the puk leadership the iranian general evoked late iraqi president saddam hussein s massive attack on a kurdish rebellion in when almost the entire kurdish population fled northern iraq to the mountains the puk lawmaker said soleimani s visit was to give a lastminute chance for the decisionmakers not to commit a fatal mistake said the lawmaker who like others interviewed in this story declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue commanders of the iraqi kurdish forces known as the peshmerga have accused iran of orchestrating the shi iteled iraqi central government s push into areas under their control a charge senior iranian officials have denied but iran has made no secret of its presence in iraq tehran s military help is not a secret anymore you can find general soleimani s pictures in iraq everywhere said an official close to iranian president hassan rouhani now beside political issues kirkuk s oil is a very key element for iran which is an opec member control of those oil fields by iran s enemies would be disastrous for us why should we let them enter the oil market kirkuk fell to iraqi government forces on monday their offensive followed a referendum last month in which the semiautonomous kurdistan region voted to secede from iraq against baghdad s wishes kurds have sought an independent state for almost a century after colonial powers divided up the middle east after the fall of the ottoman empire and left kurdishpopulated territory split between turkey iran iraq and syria but iraq s two main kurdish parties have been at odds over both the referendum and the approach to the crisis in kirkuk which the kurds consider to be the heart of their homeland the puk a close ally of iran accused its rival the kurdistan democratic party kdp of putting the kurds at risk of military intervention and isolation by pushing hard for the vote which won wide approval for independence soleimani has been allied to the puk for years but the referendum has drawn him even closer to kurdish politics and expanded iran s reach in iraq beyond the baghdad government the iranian general is no stranger to conflicts in iraq which fought an eightyear war with iran in the s he has often been seen in footage from the frontlines and iran has long helped baghdad to carry out its military strategy through paramilitary shi ite militias which it funds and arms before the referendum soleimani suggested to kurdish leaders that holding a vote on secession which iran feared would encourage its own kurdish population to agitate for greater autonomy would be risky the iranians were very clear they have been very clear that there will be conflict that these territories will be lost said one prominent iraqi kurdish politician who met soleimani ahead of the sept referendum on oct barely a week after the vote soleimani attended the funeral of puk leader jalal talabani again he wanted to make sure even his closest kurdish allies understood the dangers of not withdrawing from kirkuk officials said a senior iranian diplomat in iraq and an official in iran close to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei s office said soleimani met with kurdish leaders after talibani s funeral and urged them to withdraw from kirkuk and in exchange tehran would protect their interests soleimani met with one of talabani s sons bafel a few days after his father was buried one of the puk officials said soleimani said abadi should be taken very seriously you should understand this the official said an iranian source in iraq said soleimani was in kirkuk two nights before the iraqi government offensive for a couple of hours to give military guidance iraqi intelligence sources said tehran sent a clear signal to the puk we understand from our sources on the ground that neighboring iran played a decisive role in making the puk chose the right course with baghdad one iraqi intelligence official told reuters tensions over the referendum and kirkuk have deepened divisions between the two main political parties in northern iraq the kdp accused the puk of betraying the kurdish cause by capitulating to iran and striking a deal to withdraw the talabani clan were behind the offensive on kirkuk they asked qassem soleimani for help and his troops were there on the ground said a source close to massoud barzani president of the kurdistan regional government and head of the kdp it is becoming clear that iran is directing the operations to destroy the kdp the puk strongly denies this talabani s son bafel accused the kdp of missing a zerohour chance to avoid losing kirkuk by failing to reach a deal over a military base which iraqi government forces had demanded to take back unfortunately we reacted too slowly and we find ourselves where we are today bafel told reuters two other kurdish political sources gave a similar account iran and soleimani offered early assistance to northern iraq s kurds in the fight against islamic state a rallying point for the kurdish community but after the devastating loss of kirkuk iraqi kurds have been left disillusioned they both puk and kdp leaders just make decisions on their own and play with people s lives in the end we pay the price said pensioner abdullah ahmed in sulaimania this is a disaster for everyone everyone was united against daesh islamic state now they are back just looking out for themselves\",\n

caused him to lose what was left of his mind apparentlyon monday morning the donald s descent into madness continued as he lashed out at hillary clinton did hillary clinton ever apologize for receiving the answers to the debate trump tweeted just asking did hillary clinton ever apologize for receiving the answers to the debate just asking donald j trump realdonaldtrump april clinton has not in fact apologized for receiving the answers he means questions for a debate but she has a good reason it didn t happentrump s claim comes from a fake news story in the baltimore gazette a fake news sourcethe first presidential debate was held and hillary clinton was proclaimed the winner by the media indeed clinton was able to turn in a strong debate performance but did she do so fairly multiple reports and leaked information from inside the clinton camp claim that the clinton campaign was given the entire set of debate questions an entire week before the actual debateearlier last week an nbc intern was seen hand delivering a package to clinton s campaign headquarters according to multiple sources the package was not given to secretarial staff as would normally happen but the intern was instead ushered into the personal office of clinton campaign manager robert mook members of the clinton press corps from several media organizations were in attendance at the time and a reporter from fox news recognized the intern but said he was initially confused because the nbc intern was dressed like a fed ex employeeeven though the story is a lie rightwing websites russian trolls and everyone who hates hillary clinton jumped on the opportunity to accuse the former secretary of state of cheatinghe then pushed his insane allegation that president obama put a tapp on his

register their devices if dangerous and aircraft makers ensure that black box recordings can be downloaded in realtime if a plane is in distress under a sweeping reform of europe s aviation safety agency european union lawmakers and member states reached a tentative deal early on thursday on a longawaited reform of the european aviation safety agency easa which includes europe s first ever rules on drones under the agreement drones which can cause significant harm to people either by crashing into them or presenting risks to privacy security or the environment will have to be registered dangerous drones will be defined as having a kinetic energy of over joules based on their mass and maximum speed the european parliament had pushed for a registration threshold of grammes but eu governments resisted the rules will apply to all drones including ones sold in shops for private use the drone industry is soaring and has potential uses in agriculture delivery mapping building maintenance to ensure these activities develop in full security a european regulatory framework will prevail said karima delli chair of the european parliament s transport committee risks posed by the increasing use of drones were highlighted in october when a drone hit an aircraft landing at a canadian airport and there have been several nearmisses between drones and passenger planes in europe eu member states and the parliament had been bogged down in negotiations for a year with disagreements ranging from drone registration limits to how much easa should be bound by international co standards to whether overflights should be guaranteed when air traffic controllers are on strike thursday s agreement which was reached around cet gmt after hours of negotiations will need to be confirmed by both the parliament and national governments currently drone rules vary from country to country in europe under the deal recordings of cockpit conversations in planes will need to be downloaded to the ground in realtime when an aircraft is in distress the parliament had pushed for the provision to avoid a repeat of the disappearance of malaysian airlines flight mh which vanished three years ago in the southern indian ocean with people aboard the exact criteria under which aircraft will have to be equipped with black boxes whose recordings can be downloaded in realtime will be decided by the european commission and member states at a later stage a parliament source said the deal also ensures that easa will not be able to go beyond international standards agreed at the united nations aviation agency on pollutants and co emissions something with environmental campaigners and the parliament had pushed for in the face of this missed opportunity the european parliament is ready and waiting for an ambitious plan for co emissions reductions from transport delli said\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n
